// 1.Given an array of objects representing different shapes, write a function that changes the color of all rectangles in the array to blue.
//
//   2.Write a program that takes an image as input and swaps
//   the colors of two objects within the image.
//   For example, if the image contains a red apple and a green pear,
//   the program should be able to swap the colors so that the apple is
//   green and the pear is red.
//
//   3.Write a function that takes an array of objects representing different people and changes the age of all people in the array by adding 10 years to their current age.
//
//   4.Create a program that randomly generates a set of shapes and
//   allows the user to change the properties of those shapes
//   (such as size, color, and position) by dragging and
//   dropping them with a mouse or touch screen.
//
//   5.Write a function that takes an array of objects representing
//   different cars and changes the speed of all cars in the array
//   based on a given acceleration value.
//
//   6.Create a program that allows the user to select a portion of an
//   image and change the properties of that portion (such as brightness,
//   contrast, and saturation) while leaving the rest of the image unchanged.
//
//   7.Write a function that takes an array of objects representing
//   different animals and changes the weight of all animals in the array
//   based on a given factor (such as a percentage increase or decrease).
