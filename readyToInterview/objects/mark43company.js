// Carburetor Springs Police Department is looking to improve their response
// times to traffic collisions by setting up cameras at the intersection
// with the most traffic collisions.
// Carburetor Springs Police Department decided to hire you to help them
// determine which intersection has the most traffic collision events.
// You have been provided with a dataset consisting of history of events
// collected from the police department's records management system.

// Explanation of the Input:
//     An event consists of 3 fields: {street1, street2, numVehiclesInvolved}

// Which will be provided to you in way that works for whatever language you pick.
//     Example: {"Greenwich", "Spring", 1},
//          or: { street1: "Greenwich", street2: "Spring", numVehiclesInvolved: 1 },

// Consider the following example.

// Input:
// [
//     { street1: "Hudson", street2: "Canal", numVehiclesInvolved: 3 },
//     { street1: "6th", street2: "Canal", numVehiclesInvolved: 4 },
//     { street1: "6th", street2: "Canal", numVehiclesInvolved: 2 },
//     { street1: "Hudson", street2: "Canal", numVehiclesInvolved: 2 },
//     { street1: "Hudson", street2: "Canal", numVehiclesInvolved: 3 },
//     { street1: "Hudson", street2: "Dominick", numVehiclesInvolved: 2 },
//     { street1: "Greenwich", street2: "Spring", numVehiclesInvolved: 1 },
//     { street1: "Greenwich", street2: "Spring", numVehiclesInvolved: 0 },
// ]

// Output: "Hudson & Canal"

// In this example, the intersection, "Hudson & Canal" has the most traffic collisions and is therefore the most traffic-collision-prone intersection.

// Letâ€™s talk about your plan of attack before you start coding, and remember
// to keep talking me through what you are doing as you code.
// Don't forget to consider any possible edge cases.
